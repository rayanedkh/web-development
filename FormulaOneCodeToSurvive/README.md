## Final Project of the INF111 Module

The goal of this project was to develop a web application using an API and applying all the knowledge acquired throughout this course. As a big motorsport fan, I chose to use an open-source Formula 1 API to provide the results of all Grand Prix races, along with the final drivers' and constructors' standings for each season since 1950.

The application is called "FORMULA ONE: CODE TO SURVIVE", a reference to the popular Netflix series "FORMULA ONE: DRIVE TO SURVIVE". It consists of three main sections, accessible via three buttons, allowing users to explore the historical results of Formula 1.

The API I used is free and offers a wealth of data on Formula 1. If you’re interested in developing a similar project using this API, you can visit the following page:

This site is well-organized and provides multiple usage examples in a wide range of programming languages.
